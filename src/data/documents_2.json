      "chunk_content": "Title: Permafrost-Mimicked Conditions Foster Carnobacterium Growth Implications for Martian Microbiology\n\nGrowth of Carnobacterium spp. from permafrost under low pressure, temperature, and anoxic atmosphere has implications for Earth microbes on Mars\nWayne L. Nicholson, Kirill Krivushin, David Gilichinsky, and Andrew C. Schuerger\nDepartments of Microbiology and Cell Science and Plant Pathology, Space Life Sciences Laboratory, University of Florida, Merritt Island, FL 32953; and Institute of Physicochemical and Biological Problems in Soil Science, Russian Academy of Sciences, Pushchino 142290 Moscow Region, Russian Federation\nEdited by Henry J. Melosh, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, and approved November 9, 2012 (received for review June 8, 2012)\nThe ability of terrestrial microorganisms to grow in the near-surface environment of Mars is of importance to the search for life and protection of that planet from forward contamination by human and robotic exploration. Because most water on present-day Mars is frozen in the regolith, permafrosts are considered to be terrestrial analogs of the martian subsurface environment. Six bacterial isolates were obtained from a permafrost borehole in northeastern Siberia capable of growth under conditions of low temperature (0°C), low pressure (7 mbar), and a CO2-enriched anoxic atmosphere. By 16S ribosomal DNA analysis, all six permafrost isolates were identified as species of the genus Carnobacterium, most closely related to C. inhibens (five isolates) and C. viridans (one isolate). Quantitative growth assays demonstrated that the six permafrost isolates, as well as nine type species of Carnobacterium were all capable of growth under cold, low-pressure, anoxic conditions, thus extending the low-pressure extreme at which life can function.\n\nastrobiology | planetary protection\nA central goal of astrobiology is to explore the limits at which life can occur and to search for life and habitable locations outside Earth. The planet Mars is considered a promising astrobiological exploration target owing to its relative proximity and similarity to Earth, coupled with increasing evidence pointing to the past and present existence of liquid water at the surface and near subsurface. The current surface environment of Mars presents formidable challenges to life, such as a scarcity of liquid water and organic nutrients, extreme low temperatures, a low-pressure CO2-dominated atmosphere, harsh solar and galactic cosmic radiation, and a lack of organic nutrients. To address the question of whether terrestrial life could survive and grow in the martian environment, several researchers have turned to Mars environmental simulations conducted in chambers that replicate the temperature, pressure, atmospheric composition, regolith composition, and solar radiation environment of the Mars surface and near subsurface. Results from past experiments testing the ability of dozens of terrestrial microorganisms to grow in one such simulator demonstrated that the combination of low pressure (P; 7 mbar), low temperature (T; 0°C), and anoxic atmosphere (A), called here low-PTA conditions, posed significant barriers to growth.\n\nBecause much of the water on present-day Mars exists in a permanently frozen state mixed with mineral matrix, permafrosts on Earth are considered to be terrestrial analogs of the martian environment. On the basis of similarities between martian regolith and terrestrial permafrost, we reasoned that permafrost might contain microbes capable of growth under low-PTA conditions. In this communication we report that screening of ca. 10,000 microbes obtained from four Siberian permafrost samples resulted in the isolation of six bacterial strains capable of growth under low-PTA conditions, and that all of these isolates belonged to the Gram-positive genus Carnobacterium.\n\nResults and Discussion\nIsolation of Microorganisms from Siberian Permafrost. Samples of permafrost obtained from the Siberian arctic were suspended and plated on trypticase soy broth yeast extract salt (TSBYS) medium and incubated at room temperature (ca. 23°C) for up to 28 d. Colonies were either picked or replica-plated onto fresh TSBYS plates and incubated for 30 d under low-PTA conditions. Out of a total of ~9.3×103 colonies tested from four different permafrost soil samples, 6 colonies were observed to grow under low-PTA conditions. Five isolates were obtained from permafrost soil sample 4, and a single isolate was obtained from soil sample 9.\n\nGrowth of Permafrost Isolates Under Low-PTA Conditions. To further understand the effects of temperature, atmospheric composition, and pressure on permafrost isolates, the following experiment was performed. One hundred isolates from permafrost samples 4, 5, 8, and 9 were picked onto triplicate TSBYS plates. All plates were incubated at 0°C for 30 d under different combinations of atmosphere and pressure. The TSBYS plate incubated at Earth atmospheric composition and pressure showed luxuriant colony development with a variety of different colony morphotypes, including distinctive orange colonies. On the replicate TSBYS plate incubated under anoxic atmosphere but Earth-normal pressure of 1,013 mbar only one colony, number 43, was able to grow. This same colony was also able to grow at 7 mbar pressure under full low-PTA conditions; in fact, it seemed that colony 43 actually grew best under low-PTA conditions. Isolate 43 was streak-purified and designated strain WN1359. Despite the fact that growth of the other 99 colonies was severely inhibited by 30 d of exposure to low-PTA conditions, all colonies recovered and grew rapidly (within 24 h) upon return to laboratory benchtop conditions. This result is in good agreement with previous observations that growth inhibition of microbes caused by exposure to low pressure is apparently nonlethal and rapidly reversible.\n\nIdentification of Permafrost Isolates as Carnobacterium spp. The 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences were determined for all six isolates that could grow under low-PTA conditions and Author contributions: W.L.N., K.K., D.G., and A.C.S. designed research; W.L.N., K.K., D.G., and A.C.S. performed research; A.C.S. contributed new reagents/analytic tools; W.L.N. and K.K. analyzed data; and W.L.N., K.K., and A.C.S. wrote the paper.

The studies focus on understanding how bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms respond to the unique challenges of space environments including microgravity, radiation exposure, and limited resources.\n\nKey findings from space microbiology research include:\n- Microorganisms demonstrate remarkable resilience in space environments\n- Biofilm formation is enhanced under microgravity conditions\n- Some bacteria show increased virulence in space\n- Radiation resistance varies among different microbial species\n- Nutrient cycling and waste processing capabilities in closed systems\n\nThese studies are essential for developing life support systems for long-duration space missions, understanding planetary protection protocols, advancing astrobiology research, and improving spacecraft hygiene and crew health.\n\nMethodology involves controlled experiments aboard the International Space Station and ground-based simulations that replicate space conditions. The research utilizes advanced molecular techniques to study gene expression, protein synthesis, and metabolic changes in microorganisms exposed to space environments.\n\nPLOS ONE research on microbial life in space conditions\nWSV VUK research on space microbial adaptations",
